### Project Description: **Quiz App with Timer and Excel Integration**

This **Quiz App with Timer** is a web-based Java application that allows users to upload quiz data from an Excel file, dynamically generate quiz questions, and track time while answering. The app is designed with an intuitive interface similar to a textbook test UI, making it suitable for educational or self-assessment purposes.

### Key Features:
1. **Excel File Integration**: 
   - The application allows the user to upload an Excel file containing quiz data. This file must follow a specific structure, with the quiz title, questions, and corresponding options.
   - It uses Apache POI to parse the Excel file and extract the quiz details, ensuring smooth and efficient integration of external quiz content.

2. **Dynamic Quiz Generation**: 
   - The app reads the quiz data from the uploaded Excel file and dynamically generates the quiz interface. Each question is displayed with multiple-choice options, allowing users to select their answers.
   - The quiz is customizable with the ability to set a time limit for each question, creating an immersive timed quiz experience.

3. **Timer Functionality**: 
   - A countdown timer is associated with each question. The user has a specific amount of time to answer each question, adding a challenge and enhancing the quiz experience. Once the time expires, the app automatically moves to the next question.
   
4. **Database Integration**: 
   - The backend of the app stores quiz data in a MySQL database. This database stores quiz titles, questions, options, and correct answers. This helps manage large quiz datasets efficiently.
   - SQL queries are used for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and to dynamically fetch quiz data for display in the UI.

5. **Result Evaluation**: 
   - Once the user completes the quiz, the app evaluates the answers based on the correct options stored in the database. It provides instant feedback by showing the correct answers and the user's score at the end of the quiz.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**: 
   - The interface is designed to resemble a textbook test format with a clean, user-friendly layout. Questions and options are displayed clearly, and a timer is visible for the user to track their time during the quiz.
   - The results are shown in an organized manner, helping users understand their performance.

### Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Java (Servlets)
- **Frontend**: HTML, JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Excel Parsing**: Apache POI
- **Web Server**: Apache Tomcat
- **Libraries**: POI, MySQL JDBC driver

### Purpose:
This project aims to provide an efficient and engaging platform for quiz-based learning and self-assessment. It can be used by educators, trainers, or anyone looking to create and take quizzes in a simple yet dynamic format. By integrating Excel file support, it becomes easy to import large sets of quiz data without manual entry, saving time for content creators.

Whether for classroom use, training workshops, or personal development, this app provides a reliable and feature-rich quiz-taking experience.
